# chuneesium

A cheesy attempt to use a chunithm cab as a dj booth.

## Obligatory Warning

I got a Cursor Pro trial...

## How to Use

- Use [jvs-bridge](./jvs-bridge) in an Arduino Pro Micro to connect to the IO expander
- Use RS232 adapters and wirings of choice to connect to the LED Boards and slider (Consult the cabinet's manual for pinouts)
- Launch the app, `Cmd+,`, set the respective ports in settings, click the connect buttons and pray it works!
- Bind to Traktor via MIDI

## TODOs

- Not hardcoded control map
- More redundancy in COM port handlings
